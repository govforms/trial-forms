We can also use encryption. If you wanrt to do the same, we can discuss how you can still provide the information we need.\n\n\n**If you don’t want to use email**\n\nYou may prefer that we don’t respond by email, for example because other people have access to your email account. If so, we’re happy to respond by an alternative method. We‘ll agree this with you either by telephone, fax or in writing via post.\n\n\n**If you do want to use email**\n\nIf you would like to use email, we’ll need you to confirm in writing by post, email or fax:\n\n*that you understand and accept the risks of using email\n*that you’re content for financial information to be sent by email\n*that attachments can be used\n\nIf you are the authorised agent or representative we’ll need you to confirm in writing by post, email or fax that your client understands and accepts the risks.\n\n\n**Please also:**\n\n*send us the names and email addresses of all people you would like us to use email with - you, your staff, your representative, your agent, for example  *confirm you have ensured that your spam filters are not set to reject and/or automatically delete HMRC emails\n\n\n**How we use your agreement**\n\nYour confirmation will be held on file and will apply to future email correspondence. We’ll review the agreement at regular intervals to ensure there are no changes.\n\n\n**Opting out**\n\nYou may opt out of using email at any time by letting us know.\n\n\n[Find more information on HMRC's privacy policy](www.gov.uk/help/privacy-policy).",
